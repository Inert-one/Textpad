# Textpad
"Textpad : Text writer &amp; editor" an app for which i tried my best (of that time) to make it more user friendly and used some basic tools with pov of higher efficiency of user.
Basically this apps may look similiar to Notepad, but it's having few more advance features such as 'various theme option', 'text allignment', 'Font Styles' and many more.
This is an app i made while learning python 3.8 so it would be having few mistakes so appologies in advance.

### Dependencies 
```
pip install python
pip install tkinter
pip install os
```
